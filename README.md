# LSC APAR Worksheet
Worksheet for installation of Infor SyteLine/CSI APARs. (Patches) 

This software is intended to be installed as a module for the Infor SyteLine/CloudSuite ERP software.

# Prototype
If you want to see what the design of this software will be in the future, you can go [here](https://www.justinmind.com/usernote/tests/20974331/21457199/21457201/index.html)
 to try an interactive prototype. There is no guarantee that the prototype and the finished software will match, but it should give you an opportunity to see where the software is headed.

# Disclaimers
In its current iteration, the software is only designed to help analyze the impact and effects of a scheduled APAR installation. It does not currently include any features that would allow the user to install APARs using this system, or workflow options for planning a deployment. I highly recommend using a separate Change Management system to track the installation of APARs according to your requirements.

This software is provided under the Apache 2.0 license, and is provided without warranties or conditions of any kind. While this software is designed to run in a SyteLine installation, it does not contain any code written by Infor. If Infor changes how they do APARs, that could negatively affect the function of this software. If this happens, you are encouraged to contribute to cover that gap.
